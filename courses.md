## Programming with Python 1 \[Coming soon] Course-ID : #002

![Programming with Python 1 Wallaper](/images/python_a.png)

> Python is an easy-to-learn programming language, which is very close to pseudocode. 
> It comes with an extensive standard library, which can be supplemented by a large number of packages. 
> Since Python is not a scripting language, but a so-called interpreted high-level language, the source code can be developed platform-independently. 
> Especially in the field of machine learning and data science, Python is a popular programming language.
