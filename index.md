## About LearnML

Welcome to LearnML-Corp! We are an organization that aims to provide knowledge, projects, research on AI. And we do it for free! LearnML-Corp is a non-profit organization, which means that all members are volunteers and spend their free time on the development of LearnML. We believe in a future where AI is developed and used responsibly. This is only possible if both users and developers have some understanding of AI technology. We want to provide this understanding in the form of our projects and courses. You can visit the courses and view material on our Discord server, YouTube channel or on the GitHub organization.
